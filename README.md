# FreeRTOS Basic Multi-Task

This project develops an embedded multi-task system using the BitDogLab board, programmed with FreeRTOS in C language on VSCode. The system concurrently controls three board peripherals:

- **RGB LED**: Cyclically alternates between red, green, and blue colors
- **Buzzer**: Emits periodic beeps 
- **Two Buttons**: 
  - Button A: Suspends or resumes the LED task
  - Button B: Suspends or resumes the buzzer task

The implementation demonstrates **concurrent task execution**, **task control mechanisms**, and **real-time peripheral management** using FreeRTOS scheduling capabilities.

## Objective

Develop practical skills in embedded multi-task programming using FreeRTOS. Upon completion, you will be able to:

- Create and manage multiple tasks with FreeRTOS
- Understand scheduling and priorities in RTOS
- Use vTaskCreate(), vTaskSuspend() and vTaskResume() commands
- Control GPIOs with FreeRTOS
- Organize projects in VSCode with pico-sdk and FreeRTOS

## Bill of Materials

| Component             | BitDogLab Connection      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| BitDogLab (RP2040)    | -                         |
| RGB LED               | GPIO 11, 12, 13           |
| Buzzer                | GPIO 21                   |
| Buttons               | GPIO 5, 6                 |

## Setup and Execution

1. Open the project in VS Code with Raspberry Pi Pico SDK environment (CMake + ARM compiler);
2. Build the project normally (Ctrl+Shift+B in VS Code or via terminal with cmake and make);
3. Connect your BitDogLab via USB cable and put the Pico in boot mode (press BOOTSEL button and connect cable);
4. Copy the generated .uf2 file to the storage unit that appears (RPI-RP2);
5. The Pico will automatically restart and begin executing the code;
6. The system will run automatically: the RGB LED will cycle through colors (red, green, blue), the buzzer will beep periodically, and you can use Button A to start/stop the LED and Button B to start/stop the buzzer.


## System Logic

- **LED Task**: Cycles RGB LED through Red‚ÜíGreen‚ÜíBlue colors every 500ms
- **Buzzer Task**: Plays 700Hz tone for 500ms every 1.5 seconds  
- **Button Task**: 
  - Button A (GPIO 5): Suspend/Resume LED task
  - Button B (GPIO 6): Suspend/Resume Buzzer task
- **Task Priorities**: LED and Buzzer tasks (priority 1), Button task (priority 2)

## Project Files

- `src/main.c`: Main project code with FreeRTOS implementation;
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Build configuration file;

## Features Demonstrated

- **Task Scheduling**: Three concurrent tasks with different priorities
- **Task Control**: Suspend and resume operations via button input
- **Hardware Control**: RGB LED cycling and PWM buzzer control
- **Real-time Execution**: Non-blocking task delays using vTaskDelay()
